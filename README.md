# Peer Link

**Banking integrations, built together.**

An MIT-licensed library of bank adapters, payment semantics, privacy-safe fixtures, and community test reports. Bring your bank account and your coding agent. Turn what works for you into knowledge anyone can inspect, reproduce, and maintain.

**Targeted rewards: at most $50 per bank.** Priority goes to Monobank, Vietcombank and selected US banks. The new total authorization is $1,000 including funding fees. Check [current funding and assignment terms](docs/incentives.md) before starting paid work. Contributions from every geography are welcome.

## Start with your agent

Give your browser-capable coding agent this prompt:

> Read AGENTS.md and skills/contribute-bank/SKILL.md in https://github.com/zkp2p/peer-link. Help me contribute my bank's payment integration. Keep raw captures and credentials local. Start by identifying the bank, supported transaction type and evidence needed to interpret the bank record’s payer, payee, amount, currency and status. Do not initiate payments.

No extension is required. Your agent needs its own authorized browser tooling; this repository does not provide remote bank access. You sign into your own bank normally.

## Run locally

Node 20.19+, npm, Python 3.11+ and OpenSSL. No secrets or bank account required for fixture tests.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zkp2p/peer-link.git
cd peer-link
npm ci --ignore-scripts
npm run verify:setup
npm run check
npm run dev
```

`app/` contains the landing page. `banks/<country>/<bank>/` contains an adapter, manifest, tests, fixtures and reports. `lib/` defines a small shared observation format, not a published SDK.

## What a result means

A parser can tell you what supplied evidence says. It cannot establish that the evidence came from a bank. `supported` means the supported interpretation is present, not that funds should be released. Downstream attestation systems must authenticate evidence and apply their own settlement policy. The verification service is under development; its release manifest currently refuses live secret sharing. No production settlement or automatic payout is enabled.

Community reports are revision-specific claims, not certified unique people or bank accounts. Failures and partial results are useful. Ten reporting handles is a community milestone, not a trust or payout threshold. [Evidence model](docs/evidence.md).

## Agent maintenance and verification

Peer Link is designed for agent-assisted maintenance. Public prompts, explicit policies and machine-readable decisions make reviews inspectable. A private verifier is being built to authenticate bank evidence inside an AWS enclave, with deterministic reference checks and explicit account-owner consent.

**Current status: development, not a live verification service.** No scheduled agent tasks or automatic payouts are enabled. The old unfunded round is being replaced; see the current incentive terms.

**Venice remains disabled:** Peer Link has not independently verified its TEE execution and end-to-end response authenticity. Bank data is not forwarded to Venice or OpenAI. The [synthetic agent evaluation](docs/verification.md#synthetic-agent-evaluation) tests the advisory review task only; success does not establish Venice model accuracy or TEE security.

September 23, 2026 validation:

- [Nitro hardware tests](verification/infra/evidence/2026-09-23-nitro-components.json) passed attestation/tampering checks, 16 component tests and four synthetic Mercury Wasm cases.
- [Independent CI builds](verification/infra/evidence/2026-09-23-normalized-builds.json) produce byte-identical unsigned EIFs after informational metadata normalization. Nitro CLI validates their checksums and unchanged PCR0/1/2. A [disposable signed Nitro boot](verification/infra/evidence/2026-09-23-normalized-hardware.json) also passed attestation and tampering checks. A production signing identity and approved public release remain unfinished.
- A [synthetic Venice probe](verification/infra/evidence/2026-09-23-venice-synthetic-protocol.json) reached encrypted inference, but response signature byte binding failed. No bank data was sent.
- The consent handshake and acquisition/oracle/adapter stages have synthetic integration tests. Runtime receipts now have synthetic composition tests. Live bank acquisition and complete hardware flow validation remain release gates.

Run `npm run verify:readiness` for a machine-readable report. It currently exits with status 2 because live verification is unavailable. Passing parser tests or merging a contribution does not enable it.

CI publishes each builder's experimental unsigned `normalized.eif` with its measurements in the `nitro-build-one` and `nitro-build-two` artifacts (retained for seven days). [Download and compare instructions](docs/verification.md#inspect-experimental-ci-binaries). These are inspection artifacts, not approved releases for sharing secrets.

## Contribute

- Add a bank adapter with meaningful negative tests.
- Reproduce a provider against your own account and submit a privacy-safe report.
- Add an edge case, fix a broken integration or improve acquisition instructions.
- Sponsor a reviewed issue. No reward is promised until a sponsor explicitly funds an issue.
